This repository builds a Flask API on a Heroku app.
That API serves a tag prediction feature for StackOverflow questions.
The API should receive POST calls including the question's title and body.
It will then return a list of tags that seem related to the question,
for example ['c++', 'arrays'].

The prediction is done through a model that includes TF-IDF embeddings,
followed by a multilabel, multiclass Logistic Regression that was trained offline.

main.py includes the code to build the app, and to do predictions. It uses three
models it finds in the "models" directory. Two of them vectorize the question's
title and body. The third one does the prediction based on these embeddings.

tests/test.py includes the unit tests. They test for correct predictions,
for long input and for missing input. These tests can be fired manually.
They are also fired during deployment thanks to GitHub Actions, and to
.github/workflows/yaml_file.yml.

manual_interface.py can be used by the operator to test for specific questions.
You need to edit the question text, then type "python manual_interface.py" in
the CLI, and the API's answer will be displayed.
